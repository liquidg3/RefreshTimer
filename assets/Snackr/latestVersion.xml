<p>New in version 0.33:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Follow "snackr" on twitter</b> to get the latest Snackr news!</li>
<li>Snackr now properly renders item titles with non-Latin characters.</li>
<li>You can now select multiple feeds and delete them from the feed list.</li>
<li>Bug fixes that should eliminate duplicate items when there's only one item left in a given feed. Behavior still isn't great when you only have a few feeds and few items in each.</li>
<li>Stay-on-top (and other options) should be properly remembered between invocations now.</li>
</ul>
